# Customer documenetation blukii Hub
In this documentation the api  functions of the blukii hub are described.

## Push interface

The blukii hub received data of all blukiis and sends it to your configured server.
You must ensure that your server correctly interprets and processes the data from the blukii Hub.
The data is sent from the blukii hub via a HTTP POST or HTTP PUT interface in JSON format.
The following is a structure of a JSON record. The structure of a data record depends on the hardware variant and the configuration of the blukii sensorBeacon or smartBeacon. In the example below, the following configuration was used:
- blukii Hub
  - Serial number: SMAA9ET9WL
- blukii smartBeacon
  - blukii_address: CC78AB6FFEBF
  - Frames iBeacon, EddystoneUID, EddystoneURL and EddystoneTLM enabled 
- blukii sensorBeacon
  - blukii_address: CC78AB6FD698
  - all sensor readings are sent
